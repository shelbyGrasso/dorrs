Reservation web application

Welcome to DORRS, a web application designed to track reservations for shared conference room spaces. DORRS is an acronym that stands for "DORRS Offers Room Reservation Services."

In this iteration of the program, six conference rooms have been pre-loaded as options to book for 1-hour increments between 8am and 6pm, any day of the week. Users can create reservations up to 30 days in advance by selecting the desired date, then the corresponding time slot for the room and time. Users are asked for their name and email, along with a password they can use to delete their reservation later on, if desired. Users are given the option to delete a reservation when the reserved time slot is clicked. Reservations from past days can be viewed but are non-editable.

Currently, this program is configured using local storage, so it is best used either 1) by one person making reservations on behalf of others or 2) on a shared desktop accessible to those making reservations. Features to be implemented in application updates include server-side reservation storage, ability to create reservations for varying times, user log-ins for easier reservation editing and usage tracking, and downloadable reservation reports.
